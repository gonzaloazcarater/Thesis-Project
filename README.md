Final Thesis Project: Development of a tool for realistic network traffic generation and orchestration based on user behavior.
# Description
The general objective of this project is focused on the generation of realistic user traffic, 
firstly, a study of the different traffic generation tools used in the Internet will be carried out. 
Given the characteristics of the project, emphasis will be placed on tools focused on the generation of network traffic based on user behavior.
In order to generate this traffic, we propose the use of the NPC (NonPlayer Character) simulation tool GHOSTs, which allows simulating users, as well as their behavior through different configuration files. The purpose of using this tool is focused on the integration of these simulated users in CyberRange training platforms.
